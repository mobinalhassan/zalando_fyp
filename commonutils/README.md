# CommonUtils

Snapthat's common utilities can be used by anyone within the organization
The main goal of these utilities is to speed things up and get common tasks under one roof.
Technically these utilites must be developed keeping in mind that these will 
be consumed by other developers , with the best developer experience and scalability 
in mind.
